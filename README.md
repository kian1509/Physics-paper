# ðŸŒŒ Physics paper (Only for the bold and the curious!)
This [PDF](https://github.com/kian1509/Physics-paper/blob/main/Exam_paper_EWS.pdf) contains a research paper I independently wrote on Inflation Theory in the context of early universe cosmology. Created as part of an exam assignment (graded 17/20), the paper explores the fascinating events that may have unfolded in the moments following the Big Bang.
